# 🌐 Talentvare – Frontend Technology Stack

For the development of **Talentvare**, I’ve selected a modern and performance-focused front-end stack designed to ensure speed, scalability, and a clean development workflow.  
Each technology was chosen for its stability, maintainability, and seamless integration with modern UI/UX standards.
